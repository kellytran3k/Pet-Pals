# Pet-Pals

iOS Swift app currently under construction that applies gamification techniques to incorporate recycling into everyday life.
Set to test at Georgia State University.

The app utilizes a cute virtual pet that has a depleting life as time goes by. Users have to go to registered recycling bins and scan a QR code in order for their pet to receive 1 of 3 health points (food, care, or love) in order to keep their virtual pet alive.

Written in storyboard Swift, all by me.
